     <h3>Blade-Element Analysis for Rotors</h3>
       <p>A relatively simple method of
       predicting the more detailed performance of a helicopter rotor
       is the use of Blade Element Theory. In this method the rotor
       is divided into a number of independent sections along the
       length. At each section a force balance is applied involving
       2D section lift and drag with the thrust and torque produced
       by the section. At the same time a balance of axial momentum
       is applied. This produces a set of non-linear equations that
       can be solved for each blade section. The resulting values of
       section thrust and torque can be summed to predict the overall
       performance of the rotor.</p>
       <p>The theory does not include
       secondary effects such as 3-D flow velocities induced on the
       rotor by the shed tip vortex or radial components of flow
       induced by angular acceleration due to the rotation of the
       blades. Modifications to the flow due to cyclic loading, blade
       flapping, rotor translation and coning angle are able to be
       made in a relative simple fashion but again this may not
       encompass all second order or phase-change effects.</p>
       <p>In comparison with real rotor
       results this theory will over-predict thrust and under-predict
       torque with a resulting increase in theoretical efficiency of
       5% to 10% over measured performance. Some of the flow
       assumptions made also breakdown for extreme conditions when
       the flow on the blade becomes stalled or there is a
       significant proportion of the rotor blade in windmilling
       configuration while other parts are still thrust producing. 
       </p>
       <p>This analysis can be used in
       conjunction with momentum theory to give refined details on
       the limits to ideal performance. It can be used to define
       required collective angles, the areas of blade stall, moments
       due to out-of-balance cyclic loading, etc. The theory has been
       found very useful for comparative studies such as optimising
       blade collective setting for a given cruise speed or in
       determining the optimum blade solidity for a rotor. It is a
       tool for getting good first order predictions of thrust,
       torque and efficiency for rotors under a large range of
       operating conditions without the computational expense of
       having to go to complex solutions such as Vortex Theory or
       full 3-D unsteady flow modelling. 
       </p>
       <h2>Blade Element Subdivision</h2>
       <p>A rotor blade can be
       subdivided as shown into a discrete number of sections.</p>
       <center>
       <img src="rotor_sections.png" name="graphics3" align="middle" width="528" height="263" border="0"/>
       </center>
       <p >For each section the flow can
       be analysed independently if the assumption is made that for
       each there are only axial and angular velocity components and
       that the induced flow input from other sections is negligible.
       Thus at section <i>AA</i> (radius = $r$) shown above, the
       flow on the blade would consist of the following components. 
       </p>
       <p >where $V_0$ is the axial flow at rotor disk, $V_2$ is the tangential flow velocity vector and 
       $V_1$ is the section local flow velocity vector, summation of vectors
       $V_0$ and $V_2$.</p>
       <p >A rotor blade segment will be
       set at a given geometric pitch angle ($θ$), which will
       be a combination of collective, cyclic and blade twist. The
       local velocity vector will create a flow angle of attack on
       the section. Lift and drag of the section can be calculated
       using standard 2-D aerofoil properties. (Note: blades use a
       reference line = zero lift line, not section chord line). The
       lift and drag components normal to and parallel to the rotor
       disk can be calculated so that the contribution to thrust and
       torque of the complete rotor from this single element can be
       found.</p>
       <center>
       <img src="rotor_section_2.png" name="Image1" width="502" height="291" border="0"/>
       </center>
       <p >The difference in angle ($φ$)
       between thrust and lift directions compared to the setting
       angle ($θ$) produces a local flow angle of attack ($α$)</p>
       <p>
       $$&alpha;=&theta;-&phi;$$
</p>
       <p >where</p>
       <p>
       $$&phi;=\tan^{-1}(V_0/V_2)&asymp;{(V_i+V_c)}/V_2={(V_i+V_c)}/{&Omega;r}$$
</p>
       <p>Here, $V_0 = V_i + V_c$ where $V_i$ is the rotor induced flow
       velocity and $V_c$ is helicopter
       vertical climb velocity. As the induced and climb velocities
       are small in comparison to the rotor speed, $V_1&asymp;V_2=&Omega;r$
       </p>
       <p align="left" >Note: hover and
       vertical climb components are shown here, for forward flight
       there will be additional velocity components due to rotor tilt
       and forward speed. Forward speed will also produce variation
       in velocity components at different angles around the disk
       with blade sections heading in the direction of vehicle motion
       at some points and then retreating from vehicle direction at
       others. The modifications to $V_0$ and
       $V_2$ due to forward flight effects is
       shown later on in this section.</p>
       <p>The elemental thrust of this blade element can thus be
       written as 
       </p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;T=L\cos(&phi;)&asymp;L=1/2&rho;V_1^2C_LcB.dr$$
</p>
       <p >where $ρ$ is the air
       density, $c$ is the blade chord and small angle
       approximations are used for $φ$.</p>
       <p >The area generating the lift
       will be the element area multiplied by the number of blades
       ($B$) covering the circuit and the lift coefficient can
       be assumed to be linear with angle of attack ($α$).</p>
       <p >$$C_L=2&pi;&alpha;$$
</p>
       <p >As the angular speed of the
       rotor is much larger than the induced velocity component,</p>
       <p>$$V_1=&radic;{V_0^2+V_2^2}&asymp;V_2=&Omega;r$$
</p>
       <p >thus, 
       </p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;T=1/2&rho;(&Omega;r)^2cB{2&pi;}(&theta;-&phi;).dr$$
</p>
       <p>The thrust of the blade element may vary as it
       travels around the disk so this elemental component will need
       to be averaged along the blade path.</p>
       <p>$$&Delta;T_{avg}=1/{2&pi;}&int;_0^{2&pi;}&Delta;T.d&Psi;$$
</p>
       <p align="left">where  $Ψ$ is angular position of blade elements around the rotor
       disk.</p>
       <h2>Induced Velocity ($V_i$)</h2>
       <p >A major complexity in applying
       this theory arises when trying to determine the magnitude of
       the induced velocity ($V_i$) . $V_0$
       is the sum of this rotor induced velocity ($V_i$)
       with additional increments due to climb speed ($V_c$),
       flapping velocity ($V_f$) and
       rotor/vehicle forward speed ($U$). The induced velocity
       is a function of the thrust produced which is in turn based on
       the affects produced by the induced velocity itself, hence the
       equations for $V_0$ become non-linear.</p>
       <p >$V_1$ is
       roughly equal to the blade section's angular speed ($Ωr$)
       but may will also  have increments due to advancing/retreating
       blade speeds for forward flight . In the case of tangential
       flow, the velocity is determined by known components, provided
       minor swirling effects are ignored, so $V_1$ can
       be calculated directly. 
       </p>
       <p >To calculate $V_0$
       accurately, an axial flow momentum balance must be applied to
       predict the induced affects on a given blade element. As shown
       in the following diagram for hover or vertical climb, the
       axial flow components can be defined as a combination of
       induced velocity $V_i$ and climb speed $V_c$.</p>
       <p >A typical stream-tube of flow
       passing through the radial element <b>dr</b> would have
       velocities.</p><p align="center">
       <img src="rotor_tube.png" name="Image2" border="0"/></p><p>
       $$V_0=V_i+V_c\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"V_2=&Omega; r$$
       </p>
       <p >with local flow velocity at
       the blade section of $V_1=&radic;{V_0^2+V_2^2}$ 
       and an elemental mass flow rate through the disk section of</p>
       <p>
       $${dm}/{dt}=&rho;V_0 .dA=&rho;V_0c.dr$$</p>
       <p>Note:
       It is assumed that the downstream presure in the slipstream
       has equalised to be the same as the initial inlet area
       pressure.</p>
       <h2>Conservation of Momentum</h2>
       <p >The governing principle of
       conservation of momentum can be applied for the axial flow to
       obtain a solution for $V_i$. 
       </p>
       <p >For the axial direction, the
       change in flow momentum along a stream-tube starting upstream,
       passing through the rotor at section $dr$ and then moving
       off into the slipstream, must equal the thrust produced by
       this element of the blade.</p>
       <p align="center" ><img src="rotor_segment.png" name="Image3" align="center" > </p>
       <p >In general, to remove the
       unsteady effects due to the rotor's cyclic motion, the
       stream-tube used is one covering the complete area of the
       rotor disk swept out by the blade element and all variables
       are assumed to be time averaged values over one circuit. For
       changes in flow as the blade moves around this cycle, a
       further subdivisions into blade passage sectors will need to
       be included.</p>
       <p>Change in moment of the flow for one elemental
       segment due to the thrust created will be,</p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;T=\text"Change in momentum flow rate"$$<br />
       $$\table  &Delta; T, =, {dm}/{dt}(V_{out}-V_{in});
                          , =, &rho;A_{out}(V_s+V_c)^2-&rho;A_{in}V_c^2;
                          , =, &rho;A_{out}(V_s^2+2V_sV_c+V_c^2)-&rho;A_{in}V_c^2$$</p>
       <p align="left">since mass flow is conserved from entry to slipstream,</p>
       <p>
       $$ &rho;A_{in}V_c = &rho;A_{out}(V_c+V_s)$$</p
       <p align="left">Thus        </p>
       <p>
       $$\table &Delta;T, =, &rho;A_{out}V_s(V_s+V_c)+&rho;A_{out}V_c(V_s+V_c)-&rho;A_{out}(V_c+V_s)V_c;
                        , =, &rho;A_{out}(V_s+V_c)V_s$$</p>
       <p align="left">Mass flow at disk will also be same as mass
       flow at exit,</p>
       <p>
       $$&rho;dA(V_i+V_c)=&rho;A_{out}(V_s+V_c)$$<br />
       $$&Delta;T = &rho;dA(V_i+V_c)V_s$$</p>
       <h2>Conservation of Energy</h2>
       <p >By applying the conservation
       of energy, the work done by the rotor can be related to the
       kinetic energy change of the flow.  
       </p>
       <p>
       $$\text"Work done by element" = &Delta;T .dx$$<br />
       $$\text"Power (P) applied to the flow" = &Delta;T .V_0$$<br />
       $$P=&rho; dA (V_i+V_c)V_s(V_i+V_c)=&rho; dA (V_i+V_c)^2 .V_s$$
       </p>
       <p > Power can also be found by
       evaluating kinetic energy change for the flow.</p>
       <p>
       $$P={dE}/{dt}=1/2 {dm}/{dt}(V_{out}^2-V_{in}^2)$$<br />
       $$P=1/2 &rho;{dA}(V_c+V_i)((V_s+V_c)^2-V_c^2)=&rho;{dA}(V_i+V_c)^2 .V_s$$<br />
       $$1/2(V_s^2+2V_sV_c)=V_sV_i+V_sV_c$$<br />
       $$1/2V_s + V_c = V_i+V_c$$
       </p>
       <p align="left" >therefore         </p>
       <p>$$V_s=2V_i$$
       </p>
       <p align="left" >Thus</p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;T=&rho;dA(V_i+V_c)2V_i=&rho;2V_i(V_i+V_c)r.d&Psi;.dr$$
       </p>
       <p >where $r.dΨ.dr$ is the
       area of the elemental stream tube at the disk plane.</p>
       <p >This can be integrated around
       the disk ring shown above to get the total momentum change at
       this radius.</p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;T_{avg}=2&rho;&int;_0^{2&pi;} V_i(V_i+V_c)r.dr.d&Psi;$$
       </p>
       <p >By equating the force balance
       prediction of thrust against the momentum change prediction, a
       non-linear equation containing the unknown variable ($V_i$)
       can be formed. If there is no cyclic variation in $V_i$
       such as occurs for hover then 
       </p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;T_{avg}=4&pi;&rho;V_i(V_i+V_c)r.dr$$
       </p>
       <p align="left" >The torque
       requirement to be overcome by the motor will be,</p>
       <p>
       $$&Delta;Q_{avg}=&Delta;T_{avg} .r$$
       </p>
       <h2>Iterative Solution procedure for Blade Element Theory.</h2>
       <p >An iterative method of
       solution for the elemental stream tube flow will be necessary
       due to the non-linearity. If there are no cyclic variations
       then this can be done on the average thrust and momentum
       change equations for a radial location.  If there are cyclic
       variations in thrust loading then the process will need to be
       run on individual sector elements of the disk ring. 
       </p>
       <p >To start an initial guess of
       induced flow component $V_i$ is
       required. This is used to find the flow angle of attack on the
       blade. Blade section properties can then be used to estimate
       the element thrust and torque. With these approximate values
       of thrust and torque, the force/ momentum change equilibrium
       can be used to give improved estimates of the induced velocity
       $V_i$. This process can be repeated
       until value of $V_i$ has converged to
       within a specified tolerance.</p>
       <p >It should be noted that
       convergence for this nonlinear system of equations is not
       guaranteed. It is usually a simple matter of applying some
       convergence enhancing techniques (ie Crank-Nicholson
       under-relaxation) to get a result when linear aerofoil section
       properties are used. When non-linear aerofoil properties are
       used, ie including stall effects, then obtaining convergence
       will be significantly more difficult.</p>
       <h2>Rotor Thrust and Torque Coefficients and Efficiency.</h2>
       <p >Once the converged value of $V_i$
       is obtained, then the aerofoil section lift and drag can be
       used to predict thrust and torque for the blade element
       section. 
       </p>
       <p >The overall rotor thrust and
       torque will be obtained by summing the results of all the
       radial and sector blade element values.</p>
       <p>
       $$\text"Thrust (T)"=&sum;&Delta;T_{avg}\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torque (Q)"=&sum;&Delta;Q_{avg}\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (for all dr elements)"$$
       </p>
       <p >The non-dimensional thrust and
       torque coefficients can then be calculated along with the
       advance ratio at which they have been calculated.</p>
       <p>
       $$C_T=T/{1/2&rho;&Omega;^2R^2A}\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"C_Q=Q/{1/2&rho;&Omega;^2R^3A}$$
       </p>
       <p align="left">where $R$ is the full radius of the

       <p>A measure of the efficiency of the rotor is the Figure of
       Merit. This is the ratio of ideal induced power over actual
       required rotor power. It is most conveniently defined for the
       hover case where total rotor power is the sum of power ($P_i$)
       used to create induced velocity (ie thrust) and blade drag
       profile power ($P_0$). In the hover case
       this sum is most closely approximating actual rotor power.

       <p >For forward flight,
       maneuvering flight and when cyclic control inputs are applied,
       the local flow angles on the blade will vary around the disk
       path. In this case the thrust/momentum integration will need
       to be done with differing flow angles at different positions
       around the disk. Representative angle changes due to various
       effects are shown in the following figures. The velocity
       vectors are shown for limiting cases of $0^o$, $90^o$,
       $180^o$ and $270^o$. Intermediate values can
       be assumed to have a sinusoid variation between the limiting
       (maximum/minimum) values shown.&nbsp;</p>

       <h2>Angle changes due to forward speed.</h2>
       <p >The dominant contribution to
       local blade velocities is due to the in plane stream component
        $U.\cos(α_T).\sin(Ψ)$.
       Additional velocity components are shown in the following
       figure. All velocities are relative to the blade section.

       <p align="center"><img src="rotor_sections_3.png" name="Image6" align="center" width="643" height="455" border="0"/></p>
       <p >If left unchecked the larger
       section velocity at $90^o$ (advancing blade) and the
       reduced velocity at $270^o$ (retreating blade) will
       produce a thrust distribution giving a stong rolling moment .</p>
       <p >To counteract the problem all
       blades are articulated by various mechanisms to allow the
       blade to flap up and down as it travels oround the circuit.
       Again flapping can be assumed to be a sinusoidal motion,
       produced by this thrust imbalance. This results in additional
       vertical velocity components due to the motion of the blade.
       The exact magnitude of flapping requires a dynamic analysis of
       the moving blade system but the required amount can be
       estimated by assuming that the thrust distribution needs to be
       balanced and no residual rolling moment exists.</p>
       <p  align="center"><img src="rotor_sections_4.png" name="Image7" align="center" width="643" height="455" border="0"/></p>
       <p>Assuming
       a maximum flapping displacement of $F$ at $180^o$
       and $-F$ at $0^o$ then flapping
       velocity at tip will be $V_f\sin(Ψ)$.
       Maximum upward velocity of $V_f$ will
       occur at $90^o$ and maximum downward
       velocity at $270^o$. Note due to the
       location of the blade hinge point and flexure of the blade
       itself, the magnitude of the flapping velocity, $V_f$,
       will vary with radial position. This could be assumed to be a
       linear variation.</p>
       <p >A removal of the  rolling
       moment is achieved by reduction in section angle for the
       advancing blade and an increase in angle for the retreating
       blade. One of the limiting factors in the forward speed of a
       vehicle will be caused by the stalling of the retreating blade
       due to excessive angle of attack.</p>
